tested with no time and it seemed to work fine. time was displayed as XX:XX as expected and the 
min and max values were updated for each reading. the min/max values will never be cleared.

When powered on the device tries to connect to the wifi using existing credentials. The timeout is short.

if there are no stored AP credentials the device just works as above without having set a time.

A long button press (2 seconds) will cause the device to enter a wifimanager connect and WILL erase any existing credentials.
The timeout is 5 minutes allowing the user to enter the credentials.

Needed to change the way it obtained the time as it was unreliable. Used the same method as the basestation. Copied the
timesynch function from influxdb helper code. As a result all reference to SPIFFS were removed as the WM no longer allows
a time offset to be entered.
